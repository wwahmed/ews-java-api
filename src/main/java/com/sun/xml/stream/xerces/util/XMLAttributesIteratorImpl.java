 * Its better to extend the functionality of existing XMLAttributesImpl and also make it of type Iterator.
 * We can directly  give an object of type iterator from StartElement event. We should also have
 * Attribute object of type javax.xml.stream.Attribute internally. It would avoid the need of creating
 * new javax.xml.stream.Attribute object at the later stage.
 *
 * Should we change XMLAttributes interface to implement Iteraotr ? I think its better avoid touching XNI as
 * much as possible. - NB.
